# AetherGrid Systems - ICS/OT Web Dashboard (Vulnerable Web App)

## Description

This project is a fictional yet realistic ICS/OT web application built for a capstone cybersecurity project. Developed under the simulated company *AetherGrid Systems*, it emulates a critical infrastructure operator managing smart grid and power distribution systems across the Middle East and Africa.

This vulnerable PHP-MySQL web dashboard simulates a typical OT corporate interface, featuring login, signup, buy/sell actions, and event logging. It is hosted on a Linux VM (Apache) with the database on a separate Windows VM (MySQL), following secure segmented networking practices aligned with the Purdue Model.

├── signup.php          # Registration page
├── login.php           # Handles login requests
├── dashboard.php       # Simulated user dashboard for actions

## 💾 Database Setup (Windows VM)

**MySQL Config:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE aethergrid;
USE aethergrid;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE actions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    action_type VARCHAR(50),
    action_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add test user
INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('admin', MD5('admin123'));
```

### 🔥 Security Note:

This app is intentionally vulnerable to SQL Injection for educational red/blue team testing.

## 🌐 Apache Config (Ubuntu Linux VM)

Ensure Apache is installed and PHP enabled:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php
```

Set up logging directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/logs
sudo touch /var/www/html/logs/access.log
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/logs/access.log
sudo chmod 664 /var/www/html/logs/access.log
```

Enable logging in `php.ini` if needed:

```ini
error_log = /var/log/apache2/php_errors.log
```

Restart Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
